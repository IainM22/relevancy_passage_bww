    "## Step 1: Collect Representative Queries\n",
    "In order to perform Relevancy Training, you first need a set of representative queries that reflect what real users will ask of the Discovery service when integrated in your app. In general Relevancy Training is best suited to deal with queries expressed in natural language or phrases where there are multiple important terms. \n",
    "There are two common ways to collect these questions. One is to work with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to create questions. The other is to deploy a simple application to a set of pilot or alpha users and log/track usage. For this example we will assume questions have already been collected. "

In 1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by 1995, among the top 100; and by 1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the Atlanta Olympics . He was the UK's highest-ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved Player trophy at the ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January 1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months. During his early career he became the first player ever to be disqualified from the Wimbledon tournament in 1995. The young Henman thrashed a ball in a fit of pique during a doubles match, striking ball girl Caroline Hall on the head. He made a public apology after the incident. Henman came to the attention of the wider tennis world in 1996 when he came from match point down, saving two successive match points with aces when serving at 3–5 and 15/40, and then breaking his opponent's serve twice in a row to win the final set 7–5 and beat reigning French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the first round at Wimbledon, going on to reach the quarter finals before losing to Todd Martin . A few weeks later he was to reach the Men's Doubles final at the 1996 Summer Olympics in partnership with Neil Broad, losing to #1 seeds Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to receive the silver medal. By the time he reached the last 16 at the US Open later in the year, he was firmly established as a top player. He won his first ATP Tour title in January 1997, beating Carlos Moyá at the Sydney International event. He was seeded 14th at Wimbledon, and again reached the quarter-final, defeating reigning champion and 4th seed Richard Krajicek in the fourth round before falling to 1992 champion Michael Stich. In 1998 he went one better, reaching the semi-final for the first time, by which time he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. Henman came close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, losing in the semi-finals in 1998, 1999, 2001 (when just two points from victory at one point) and 2002. In 2000 he reached the fourth round and in 1996, 1997, 2003 and 2004 he lost in the quarter-finals. The first two of those semi-final losses were to Pete Sampras , who went on to win the title on both occasions. In 2002 he lost to Lleyton Hewitt who was ranked number one in the world at the time, and who also won the title: as, indeed, did Goran Ivanisevic , a former two-time finalist (although only in this tournament as a wild card) in 2001. One of the tournaments in which he has been most successful is Queen's Club . He reached the final in 1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras , and went on to reach the final again in 2001 and 2002, where both times he lost to Lleyton Hewitt . From then on, he was expected to be the first man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a major for Britain - although in the end he never actually managed it, Wimbledon 2001 being the closest that he even came to reaching a final. He became well known for the Henman fist , which would become his trademark on winning a point.\",\n",
